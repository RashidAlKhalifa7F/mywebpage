        <h3> Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Manchester United did not go on an overseas tour in the 2021–22 pre-season. Instead, they played matches in England, 
            beginning with an away match against Championship side Derby County – managed by United's record goalscorer, Wayne Rooney – on 18 July 2021. Tahith Chong, who was
            playing despite having agreed to join Birmingham City on loan for the season, scored the first goal in the 18th minute. He was substituted at half-time by Facundo 
            Pellistri, who added a second on the hour mark. Colin Kazim-Richards pulled a goal back for Derby, but United held on to win 2–1. United's next game was against 
            Queens Park Rangers on 24 July. Jesse Lingard opened the scoring in the third minute, but Charlie Austin equalised four minutes later. QPR then scored three goals 
            in the space of eight minutes in the second half to give them a 4–1 lead with half an hour to play. Anthony Elanga pulled a goal back for Manchester United in the 
            73rd minute, but it was not enough to prevent defeat.
            
            <h3>  On 28 July, United returned to Old Trafford to play Premier League debutants Brentford. Elanga scored his second goal in two games in the 12th minute, only for
                Shandon Baptiste to equalise eight minutes later. Andreas Pereira then put United in front again with a volley from 25 yards out that went in off the underside of
                the crossbar; however, Bryan Mbeumo equalised for Brentford with 12 minutes left to play, and the visitors left with a draw. United were scheduled to play an 
                away game against another Championship club, Preston North End, on 31 July, but the match was cancelled due to a number of suspected positive COVID-19 tests 
                within the Manchester United team. The final pre-season game was at home to fellow Premier League side Everton on 7 August; United were 3–0 up by half-time 
                via goals from Mason Greenwood, Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes, before Diogo Dalot scored a fourth in the second half.</h3>

            <h3> The first of four signings was signalled on 1 July when an agreement to acquire Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund was announced. The England winger's 
                transfer was finalised 22 days later.The Reds confirmed the arrival of experienced goalkeeper Tom Heaton, on a free transfer from Aston Villa on 2 July, 
                for his second spell at the club. United added four-time Champions League winner Raphael Varane to the squad on 14 August, with the former Real Madrid 
                centre-back being introduced to a packed Old Trafford shortly before his new team-mates demolished Leeds United 5-1 in the club's opening Premier League fixture.
                Finally for incomings, a spectacular development took place on 27 August when the club revealed a deal had been struck with Juventus for the return of Cristiano
                Ronaldo. The transfer was completed, subject to international clearance on deadline day, 31 August. </h3>

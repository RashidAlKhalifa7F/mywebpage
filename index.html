        <h3> Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Manchester United did not go on an overseas tour in the 2021–22 pre-season. Instead, they played matches in England, 
            beginning with an away match against Championship side Derby County – managed by United's record goalscorer, Wayne Rooney – on 18 July 2021. Tahith Chong, who was
            playing despite having agreed to join Birmingham City on loan for the season, scored the first goal in the 18th minute. He was substituted at half-time by Facundo 
            Pellistri, who added a second on the hour mark. Colin Kazim-Richards pulled a goal back for Derby, but United held on to win 2–1. United's next game was against 
            Queens Park Rangers on 24 July. Jesse Lingard opened the scoring in the third minute, but Charlie Austin equalised four minutes later. QPR then scored three goals 
            in the space of eight minutes in the second half to give them a 4–1 lead with half an hour to play. Anthony Elanga pulled a goal back for Manchester United in the 
            73rd minute, but it was not enough to prevent defeat.
            
            <h3>  On 28 July, United returned to Old Trafford to play Premier League debutants Brentford. Elanga scored his second goal in two games in the 12th minute, only for
                Shandon Baptiste to equalise eight minutes later. Andreas Pereira then put United in front again with a volley from 25 yards out that went in off the underside of
                the crossbar; however, Bryan Mbeumo equalised for Brentford with 12 minutes left to play, and the visitors left with a draw. United were scheduled to play an 
                away game against another Championship club, Preston North End, on 31 July, but the match was cancelled due to a number of suspected positive COVID-19 tests 
                within the Manchester United team. The final pre-season game was at home to fellow Premier League side Everton on 7 August; United were 3–0 up by half-time 
                via goals from Mason Greenwood, Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes, before Diogo Dalot scored a fourth in the second half.</h3>

            <h3> The first of four signings was signalled on 1 July when an agreement to acquire Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund was announced. The England winger's 
                transfer was finalised 22 days later.The Reds confirmed the arrival of experienced goalkeeper Tom Heaton, on a free transfer from Aston Villa on 2 July, 
                for his second spell at the club. United added four-time Champions League winner Raphael Varane to the squad on 14 August, with the former Real Madrid 
                centre-back being introduced to a packed Old Trafford shortly before his new team-mates demolished Leeds United 5-1 in the club's opening Premier League fixture.
                Finally for incomings, a spectacular development took place on 27 August when the club revealed a deal had been struck with Juventus for the return of Cristiano
                Ronaldo. The transfer was completed, subject to international clearance on deadline day, 31 August. </h3>

            <h3> The league season started with a home match against Roses rival Leeds United on 14 August 2021. Bruno Fernandes scored a hat-trick, and Mason
                 Greenwood and Fred scored the other two goals in a 5–1 win, as Paul Pogba equalled a Premier League record with four assists. Luke Ayling scored 
                the only goal for the visitors.The following week, United travelled to face Southampton, and went behind on the half-hour mark, when Fred 
                deflected Ché Adams' shot past David de Gea for an own goal. Greenwood equalised 10 minutes into the second half, but United were unable to find a
                winner and the game finished 1–1, extending United's unbeaten away run to 27 league matches, equalling the record set by Arsenal in 2004. That 
                record was broken the following week, when on 29 August 2021, United travelled to face Wolverhampton Wanderers in the final match before the first
                international break of the season. Raphaël Varane made his debut following his move from Real Madrid, and provided the assist as Greenwood scored 
                the only goal of the game to secure a 1–0 win.
                 United's first game after the international break was at home to Newcastle United on 11 September and marked Cristiano Ronaldo's second debut 
                for the club after re-signing from Juventus. It took him until injury time at the end of the first half to open the scoring, turning home the 
                rebound after Newcastle goalkeeper Freddie Woodman spilled a long-range shot from Greenwood. Javier Manquillo equalised for Newcastle in the 56th 
                minute, but Ronaldo restored United's lead six minutes later with a shot through Woodman's legs following a through-ball from Luke Shaw. Fernandes 
                then scored a third with a long-range strike 10 minutes from full time, before Jesse Lingard scored his first goal for the club since August
                2020, as United won 4–1 to return to the top of the table.In the next match away to West Ham United on 19 September, United went behind on 
                the half-hour when a shot from Saïd Benrahma was deflected past De Gea off Varane; however, less than five minutes later, Ronaldo scored the 
                equaliser, following up after his original shot was saved by Łukasz Fabiański. A minute from the end of normal time, Lingard put United in front
                with a curling shot into the top corner from just inside the penalty area, but deep into injury time, West Ham were awarded a penalty after Shaw 
                was deemed to have handled the ball in his own area. Mark Noble was brought on specifically to take the kick, but De Gea dived the right way to 
                make the save;it was his first penalty save in the league since October 2014. United then played host to Aston Villa on 25 September, and 
                lost defenders Shaw and Maguire to injury either side of half-time. The match remained goalless until the 88th minute, when Kortney Hause headed 
                in a corner. The Villa defender then gave away a penalty in injury time when he handled the ball after an Edinson Cavani flick-on; however,
                Fernandes' shot went over the bar, giving Villa their first win at Old Trafford in any competition since December 2009. </h3>

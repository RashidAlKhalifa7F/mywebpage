    <h1> The Green Lake </h1>
    
    <h3> This is a poem wrriten by Dorothea Lasky and it is all about the nature around the fascinating Green Lake!</h3>
    
    <p> What work will you leave behind <br>
I ask the tailor <br>
Who has sewn the button upon my shoe <br>
I can walk again <br>
Yesterday everything felt so hopeless <br>
Now I have the energy to sit in the sun <br>
All of the damned seething baths <br>
Now I am finally on my own <br>
When I go places I call her <br>
And unload my fashionable happenstance <br>
I used to stop in the street and pick up an acorn <br>
There were so many things I used to do <br>

In the middle of the fire <br>
I went and thought to mention it to the ghost <br>
I have already burned, it said <br>
Its face was like my fatherâ€™s but was different<br>
What work will you leave behind <br>
I asked myself while in the rain <br>
Oh, this and that, it answered me <br>
And handed me the stars, then the moon </p>

<h1> Thank You</h1>
